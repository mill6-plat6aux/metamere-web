                <p>A blockchain is a storage that is designed to be tamper-resistant by connecting hash values of data elements in a chain so that the cost of tampering with the data in the chain exceeds the cost of generating the data. Unlike ordinary databases that realize so-called CRUD, such storage cannot be updated or deleted in the usual way. Furthermore, in order to realize the above-mentioned design, data must be registered without interruption. Therefore, its use is likely to be limited to things such as transaction ledgers and access logs. However, due in part to the overuse of the term “tamper-resistant” by marketers in the cryptocurrency frenzy, it is often the case that storage that could originally be designed simply and securely with RDBs is replaced with blockchain. The market has often gone to the trouble of replacing storage that can be designed simply and securely with RDBs with blockchain. Today, after overcoming some failures, and partly due to the significantly inferior performance of the most prominent blockchains as storage, the disaster of forcing blockchains on users is becoming less and less common.</p>
                <p>So, we are finally in a situation where programmers can peacefully study blockchain, but first let us bury the lies that marketers have been calling out in various places as excuses. As mentioned above, the most prominent blockchain products are significantly inferior in performance compared to RDBs in general. In contrast, “It is wrong to compare blockchain with RDBs in the first place. The difference in performance is a trade-off for the functionality gained from blockchain." This is a very common excuse used by marketers. In the first place, it was the marketers who encouraged the use of blockchain to replace the functionality that could be achieved with RDB, so this is now a joke involving users and system engineers. In addition, the product's community itself adopted a strategy of building an ecosystem by replacing an existing technology that is not very new with a newly coined term, which has led to an enormous increase in costs, such as recruiting human resources and improving the operating environment. As you may have guessed by now, the marketers were trying to make money by taking advantage of this situation.</p>
                <p>The most prominent products of blockchain have been open source. But the coders who are hired by marketers don't even try to read these sources. They are desperate to read the terms and APIs coined by the community and become an element of their ecosystem. Our indifference is responsible for the situation. The aforementioned marketer nonsense can be kicked to the curb by reading the source code. The inferior performance is simply because the source code is written that way. There are no new concepts to learn, nothing beyond the clarity and impact of Satoshi Nakamoto's paper.</p>
                </p>The situation is not a little spiteful, with marketers who have never read the WHATWG specifications incrementing the Web version without permission. It's all well and good to create a market, but we don't want to see the systems that are part of our daily lives eroded. We programmers should learn some knowledge from clear source code and try to bring them closer to what they should be.</p>
